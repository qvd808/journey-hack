## Introduction
This is a project created for Hackathon Journey 2024. To use our app, please our [web app](https://journey-hack-6107f.web.app/)

## Inspiration
Mental health is one of the most overlooked parts of self improvement. Part of this is due to the fact that working on our mental health through means such as meditation and breathing exercises is **boring**. Thus, many of us tend to ignore improving our mental health until it becomes too late. That got us thinking. What if we could make improving mental health less boring? Then certainly more people would do it! And that's where we got our idea to gameify breathing exercises to help people improve upon their mental wellbeing. 

## What it does
Introducing SproutfulAI - a fun, AI powered mental wellness self improvement app. Users are guided through a brand new breathing exercise every time they enter our app (thanks to OpenAI's GPT Turbo 3.5 API). After the user completes the breathing exercise, they are rewarded with the opportunity to water their sprout, which grows each time it's watered. Our beautiful UI design combined with our fun sprout watering functionality encourages users to do their breathing exercises and provides an environment for them to do it in a much more entertaining manner

- ✅ Different breathing exercises each time to keep users entertained (thanks to AI)
- ✅ Watering the sprout is fun and motivates users to do their breathing exercises to improve mental health!
- ✅ Beautiful UI design that relaxes and soothes users

## How we built it
- We built it using React, TailwindCSS, and the OpenAI API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Responsiveness and beautiful UI
- Great teamwork
- Learned Lots!

## What's next for Sproutful
We plan on adding:
- User authentication
- Background music
- Calendar page that keeps track of which days the user has done their breathing exercises
- Sprout that turns unhealthy if the user has not watered it for a long time
